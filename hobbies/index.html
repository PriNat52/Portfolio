		<p>
			When I started working with kids I observed that the important physical sense most of the children enjoyed was sensory.
			So I gradually started introducing such projects with the students in my class. The children not only enjoyed playing
			with the finished product, but also enjoyed making them together with teachers/family and friends. By doing so, I saw
			lots of milestone developments with the children.
