Komodo IDE is an integrated development environment (IDE) for dynamic programming languages. It is a cross-platform IDE for all major languages including Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Node.js, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Komodo IDE has an open source counterpart called Komodo Edit.

Komodo Edit is a text editor, that contains something powerful yet simple for beginners to work with. Most of the code base are shared between Komodo Edit and IDE, although more advanced features are reserved for Komodo IDE.

Unique qualities are it offers two versions, one is for light users can get small projects done and another is for the advanced level user. Both versions Komodo Edit and Komodo IDE can be downloaded for free and multi language editors.
